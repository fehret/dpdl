# Models and PEFT

In this document, we summarize how DPDL handles models, covering three model sources: [PyTorch Image Models (timm)](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models), and custom.
Further we describe how to use parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning ([PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft)) with the models.
We aim to keep the document brief and point to code for further details.

## Overview

Model creation happens in [ModelFactory](../dpdl/models/model_factory.py).
The main selection logic is:
- If `--task` is a language task (i.e. CausalLM, InstructLM or SequenceClassification), load a HuggingFace model via [HuggingfaceLanguageModel](../dpdl/models/hugging_face_models.py).
- Otherwise, by default we use `timm` models, unless the model name matches one of the provided, custom models (e.g., `wrn-<depth>-<width>` for [WideResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146) or `koskela-net`).

After initialization, we wrap the models in [ModelBase](../dpdl/models/model_base.py), which provides a common interface (e.g. loss, metrics, save/load, etc.) for the underlying models.

## Timm models (vision)

When `--task` is **not** a language task and the model name does not match a custom model, [ModelFactory](../dpdl/models/model_factory.py) calls `timm.create_model()` to instantiate the requested model.
The factory gets the parameters from [ConfigurationManager](../dpdl/configurationmanager.py) and creates the model as requested.
The requested model is specified with the `--model-name` CLI switch, and loading pretrained weights is controlled by the `--pretrained`/`--no-pretrained` switch.

## HuggingFace models (language)

When `--task` is one of `CausalLM`, `InstructLM` or `SequenceClassification`, DPDL uses [HuggingfaceLanguageModel](../dpdl/models/hugging_face_models.py) to load HF models via the [Transfomers API](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index).

If you need model‑specific behaviors (e.g., special tokenization), consult the upstream model docs and extend `HuggingfaceLanguageModel` as needed.

## Custom models

DPDL includes a small set of custom models, that have been implemented on a case-by-case needs:
- [WideResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146) via name pattern `wrn-<depth>-<width>`.
- KoskelaNet (used in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03832.pdf)) via name `koskela-net`.

Should you need to implement a custom model, use the above implementations as an example.
In essence:
- Implement a new module under `dpdl/models/` while following the [ModelBase API](../dpdl/models/model_base.py).
- Extend the checks in [CustomBuilder.matches()](../dpdl/models/custom_builder.py) to match your model.
- Extend [CustomBuilder.get_model()](../dpdl/models/custom_builder.py) to instantiate your model correctly.

## PEFT (parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning)

We provide an [implementation](../dpdl/peft.py) for some PEFT models.
PEFT is configured via `--peft MODE`
- `lora`: [Low‑rank adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) for supported timm/HF model families.
- `film`: [FiLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07871) parameterization (e.g., train only norm scale/bias plus the head).
- `head-only`: Train only the (classifier) head.

Please note that LoRA/FiLM require model‑specific patterns and unsupported model names will raise an error until a new config is added in [peft.py](../dpdl/peft.py).

Additionally, the classifier (head) can be initialized to zero using the `--zero-head` option, following [prior work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01190).

### Why PEFT can be useful for DP

In DP training, larger numbers of trainable parameters tend to increase average per‑step gradient magnitudes, which in turn increases the scale of injected noise for a fixed clipping bound.

This is one reason PEFT can be attractive under tight privacy budgets: it keeps optimization focused on a smaller parameter subset while reducing the effective scale of DP noise.

## Summary and a word about multi-modal models

In practice, the main distinction is:
- **Vision**: timm models + image transforms.
- **Language**: HuggingFace models + tokenizer transforms.

A natural future extension is multimodal models, which likely would require a new model wrapper and adapter logic to handle mixed inputs.
